const editor = document.getElementById("editor");
const preview = document.getElementById("preview");

function displayHtml(event) {
  let markdownText = event.target.value;
  display(markdownText);
}

function display(markdownText) {
  marked.setOptions({
    breaks: true });

  preview.innerHTML = marked.parse(markdownText);
}

function loadInitial() {
  const placeholder = `# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!

## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other cool stuff:

Heres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

**This is boled text**

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.


1. And there are numbered lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:

`;
  display(placeholder);
  editor.innerHTML = placeholder;
}

editor.addEventListener("keyup", displayHtml);

// On Load
loadInitial();
